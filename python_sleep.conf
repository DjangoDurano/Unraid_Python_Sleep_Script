# excluded_remote_ip: exclude ip/ips for remote user, multiple ips can be separate by ",": 192.168.4.20
# wait_array_inactivity: check array disks if disks are busy, if set array disks will be automatic add to "used disks",
#                        if you only want check some specific disk from array, let this option be False and add disk manually to "used_disks":
#                        True / False
# wait_disk_inactivity: check if disks are busy, must be always True if you want check some disk: True / False

# add_cache_drives: adds automatic **all** cache drives to "used_disks": True / False
# delay_after_inactivity: delay after all checks are have no activity to shutdown/sleep in minutes: 30
# ethernet_interfaces: ethernet interface to watch for network traffic activity, multiple interfaces possible,
#                      separate by ",", if empty all interfaces will be watch (not recommend), choose your interface from
#                      "ethernet_interfaces" at config file: eth0 or eth0, eth1

# smb_shares: choose shares to watch for smb activity, if empty all shares (user, disk) will be watched, choose share from
#             "user_shares" or "disk_shares" in config file, separate by ",": music or music, video, data
# wol_options_before_sleep: wol option to be set before sleep, works only on sleep command: p,u,m,b,g
# wol_interface: interface to set wol options to: eht0
# log_to: choose where to log to:
#         1 = logs to flash (/boot/logs/python_sleep.log)
#         2 = logs to syslog (/var/log/syslog)
#         3 = logs to flash and syslog
#         4 = logs to console
# debug: debugging on/off: True / False
# check_for_new_disks: check for new added disks, shares, ethernet interfaces to be added to conf file in minutes: 1440
